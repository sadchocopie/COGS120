Our iterative process of design include needfinding, rapid prototyping, user tesing and redesign, and comparative evaluations.

<h2>Description</h2>
<a href=""https://sadchocopie.github.io/COGS120/><b>LineUp</b></a> is to improve online shoppers' experiences in finding the best item among comparable items.
</br>
</br>
<h3>Search</h3>
User, for instance, can look for "christmas tree" on the site.  LineUp will present items that matched the title "christmas tree" from different online shopping sites. 
<em>These (limited) data are stored in a local file with previously scrapped information online.</em>
</br>
</br>
User can then "like" or "unlike" items showed up from the current search.

</br>

<h3>Analysis</h3>
By going to the user's "saved" list, the user can see what item they have liked, and perform an analysis on which of the items is the best option to purchase, taking into account the items' prices and ratings.
</br>
</br>
<em>Upon different search queries, user can only like items from the same query, or the "saved" list will clear previous saved items, so users don't compare items of different categories.</em>
